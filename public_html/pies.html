		<h2>Background on our Pies</h2>
		<p>We base our pies off of a 200 year old recipe from Belgium. Each pie takes over 2 hours to prepare and bake. You might have seen our pies at prestigious events like Iowa county and state fairs. Our cherry pie has won many awards at these events. In order to create the highest quality pies, we only use the freshest of ingredients and source 80&percnt; of our fruit from local farmers.</p>
		<h2>Types of Pie Available</h2>
		<p>Some flavors are seasonal and only available at select times. Please contact your closest bakery location for more information.</p>
		<p>Pies can be purchased individually or in bulk. The prices listed are for individual sales, contact the owners for more information on buying in bulk.</p>
