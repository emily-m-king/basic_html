		<h2>Our Story</h2>
	<p>Emily and Abby started this bakery in the small town of Indianola Iowa in 2021. They wanted to bring joy and baked goods to the stressed college students of Simpson College. Soon after creating their business, thanks to a website created in a Web Development class, their business took off quickly! After partnering with several investors, they now have 8 locations all across the country. Those locations include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Des Moines, Iowa</li>
		<li>Kansas City, Missouri</li>
		<li>Omaha, Nebraska</li>
		<li>Chicago, Illinois</li>
		<li>Minneapolis, Minnesota</li>
		<li>Houston, Texas</li>
		<li>Cleveland, Ohio</li>
		<li>Madison, Wisconsin</li>
	</ul>
	<p>For more information on products offered at any of these locations, please contact the owners.</p>
	<h2>Our Backgrounds</h2>
	<p>During their time at Simpson College, Emily majored in math and computer science and Abby majored in multimedia journalism. Both were more than willing to forget their intended career paths to instead make bakery goods for life. They have no regrets about this decision.</p>
